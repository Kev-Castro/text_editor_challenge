## Description

- This Challenge helped me understand Node.JS, nodemon, PWA, and more about Heroku and fully understanding the back-end. 

- This Challenge has helped me realize how many things can be done the further we get into the bootcamp. 

- This Challenge helped me understand how to start writing code from scratch, how to apply different functions in JS and Node and how to connect it to MYSQL,and how PWA's work and how to put it all together to make it all work together.

## Installation

- To install:

    - You will need to clone the Repo from my [Github Account](https://github.com/Kev-Castro/text_editor_challenge).
    - Clone the SSH, open it into your VSCode or where ever you run your code and you will be able to see all of my work and all the code I wrote to make this challenge operate.

    - You are going to want to run 'npm i' to install all the packets needed to run this in your local pc.

    - You will need to run 'npm run start' to run the server on you local pc. 

    - If you are already running something in your localhost under 3000, feel free to change that in the server.js file to something avaliable to you and it will run. 
   

## Creation

- I had to make a repo, git clone the repo into my local pc to start working on the site, git add, commit and push ever changes made.
